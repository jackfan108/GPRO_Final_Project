1. Is this kind of scrolling ok?
2. hard code map
3. how to decide how many files to have; lib.py?
4. pyglet????

Things to implement:
v - Ground detection and Gravity
 - sprite center calibration
 - combo input
 - double character
 - network (server/client)



special things I learned:
 - mapcreator.py = create ground objects to attach to map
 - mapeditor = edit the ground objects in a map
 - imgflip.py = image manipulating
 - name.py = filename editting
 - ***character focusing scrolling***
 - serialization on map data
 - implement sprite animation
 - complicated logic with map moving + character moving + animation switching
